    <div class="aside">Greenland might be a long way from anywhere but it offers the adventurous fly fisher an opportunity to experience a different world. Wild landscapes of icebergs, rivers, oceans and wildlife like you would not believe. Greenland is an experience you will never forget. Greenland offers some of the finest fly fishing on the planet, the ecosystem is unspoiled unlike anywhere on earth, offering perfect clean water for the millions of sea run arctic char which migrate the many streams of South Greenland. This is a lot more than just a fishing trip. This is a chance to experience wilderness at its most pure and perfect.</div>
    <div class="sidebar">The Arctic char or Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) is a cold-water fish in the family Salmonidae, native to alpine lakes and arctic and subarctic coastal waters. Its distribution is circumpolar.

    <div class="article">When the arctic char arrive in the fiords of Greenland in June, the anglers have long since planned their trip, prepared fly rods and packed their fishing gear. We know that because they knock impatiently on the door in July, ready to go, as soon as the fish migrate up the rivers in large numbers to reproduce. Soon begins a short, intense season, when the char, desperate to escape the fish hook, turns and twist its body in a powerful torque, and drags the angler around in a duel that challenges both parties.<div class="kassi"> Departure from Keflavik airport 16:45, but it´s best to be there 3 hours early. Arrival in Narsarsuaq 17:30.</div> We come and pick you up at the airport and sail to Narsaq, the boat trip takes approx. 1 hour. Check in at the hotel, dinner and a small meeting with the guide to get oriented and better informed. The next morning we sail of towards the Paradise Valley, it is a 3 hour sail so pick back and enjoy the amazing scenery of South Greenland on the way. We make a stop in Nanortalik, a small fishing village close to the Paradise Valley, to get supplies…..food, drinks and whatever you need to have at hand for the next 4 days. We sail to a farm close to a small village called Tasiusaq, where the farmer greats us and takes us to the lake. There is an hour sail along the lake into the bottom where we will spend the next three nights camping and fishing a beautiful, highly remote place called the Paradise Valley.</div>
